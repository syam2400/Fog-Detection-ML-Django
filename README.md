Fog Detection System with Django Web App
This project combines deep learning and Django to create a real-time fog detection system for enhanced road safety.

Abstract:

The system utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a diverse fog image dataset to analyze live camera feeds. This allows for:

Real-time monitoring: Prompt responses to changing fog conditions.
Alerting mechanism: Notifications sent to authorities when fog intensity exceeds thresholds.
User-friendly interface: Visualize real-time fog data and historical trends.
Django Integration:

The system seamlessly integrates with Django, offering features like:

Real-time fog identification
Continuous monitoring
User authentication
Model retraining adaptability
Scalable deployment
Project Overview:

Objective: Enhance road safety by providing real-time fog information.
Technologies: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, Django
Key Features:

Fog Detection: Core functionality for identifying fog in camera images.
Image Processing: Techniques to enhance features in captured images for improved model performance.
Real-time Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of live camera feeds.
Alert Generation: Notifications triggered when fog intensity surpasses thresholds.
Visualization: User interface for displaying real-time and historical fog data.
Django Integration: Features listed in the Abstract section.
Technical Implementation:

Data Collection: Gather images with varying fog levels for training and validation.
Model Development: Develop a CNN-based fog detection model using TensorFlow/Keras.
Training and Validation: Train the model using the collected dataset and validate its accuracy.
Image Processing: Implement techniques to improve image quality before feeding them to the model.
Real-time Monitoring System: Continuously capture images, process them, and analyze them with the model.
Alerting Mechanism: Send alerts when fog intensity exceeds predefined thresholds.
Getting Started (Modify for your specific setup):

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/fog-detection-django.git
Install dependencies (refer to requirements.txt for specific packages).
Configure Django settings (database, email for alerts, etc.).
Run database migrations: python manage.py migrate
Set up a camera feed for real-time image capture.
Run the development server: python manage.py runserver
Further Development:

Explore advanced sensors for improved fog detection.
Implement dynamic threshold adjustments based on environmental factors.
