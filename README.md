Fog Detection System with Django Web App

This project leverages deep learning and Django to create a real-time fog detection system that estimates fog percentage in uploaded videos and triggers alerts for traffic control when fog intensity surpasses a threshold.

Abstract:

The system utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a diverse fog video dataset to analyze uploaded videos. This enables:

Fog Percentage Estimation: Provides a quantitative measure of fog intensity.
Real-time Monitoring (Optional): Integrates with live video feeds for continuous monitoring (implementation details depend on specific hardware and software setup).
Alerting Mechanism: Sends notifications to traffic control offices when the estimated fog percentage exceeds a predefined threshold.
User-friendly Web Interface: Visually displays fog data (percentage, timestamps, historical trends) and facilitates management tasks.
Django Integration:

The system seamlessly integrates with Django, offering features like:

Secure video upload capabilities
Fog percentage estimation using the trained CNN model
Real-time monitoring integration (if applicable)
Customizable alerting system for traffic control

Project Overview:

Objective: Enhance road safety by providing quantitative fog data and triggering alerts for traffic control.
Technologies: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, Django
Key Features:

Fog Percentage Estimation: Core functionality for estimating the fog intensity in uploaded videos.
Video Processing: Preprocessing techniques to prepare videos for model input, potentially including frame extraction, resizing, normalization, etc.
Alert Management: Define and manage alert thresholds and notification mechanisms for traffic control.
Visualization: User interface for displaying real-time or historical fog data (percentage, timestamps, trends) on a map or other relevant visualization.
Django Integration: Features listed in the Abstract section.
Technical Implementation:

Data Collection: Gather diverse video samples with varying fog levels for training and validation.
Model Development: Develop a CNN-based fog detection model using TensorFlow/Keras, specifically trained for video analysis.
Training and Validation: Train the model using the collected video dataset and validate its accuracy on a separate validation set.
Video Processing Pipeline: Implement video processing techniques to prepare frames for model input.
Fog Percentage Estimation: Use the trained model to estimate the fog percentage in each video frame and aggregate the results for the entire video.
Alerting Mechanism: Integrate logic to trigger alerts (email) to traffic control when the estimated fog percentage exceeds the threshold.
Getting Started (Modify for your specific setup):

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/syam2400/Fog-Detection-ML-Django.git
Install dependencies (refer to requirements.txt for specific packages).
Configure Django settings (database, email for alerts, etc.).
Run database migrations: python manage.py migrate
Set up the web application (user authentication, video upload functionality, alert configuration).
Run the development server: python manage.py runserver
Further Development:

Explore advanced video processing techniques for robustness.
Integrate with real-time video feeds from strategically placed cameras.
Implement dynamic threshold adjustments based on environmental factors.
Enhance the visualization dashboard with interactive features and historical data analysis.
Additional Notes:

Consider security aspects, especially when handling video uploads and user authentication.
Explore cloud deployment options for scalability and real-time video processing needs.
